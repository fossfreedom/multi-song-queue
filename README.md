# multi-song-queue
rhythmbox plugin to add a new queue source allowing multiple songs to be added

currently just an idea.  Add a new local source which looks and feels like the queue playlist.

Have the ability to drag and drop/add songs from other music sources.  This playlist key enhancement is that you can have the same song appear in the playlist multiple times.

Possibly mimic the RhythmDBQueryModel - backend is again a GtkTreeModel but dont stop same item being added.
